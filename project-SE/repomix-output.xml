This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.

<file_summary>
This section contains a summary of this file.

<purpose>
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
</usage_guidelines>

<notes>
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

## 4. Text Search + Filters (AND Logic)

### Test 12: Text search + single filter
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "luxury",
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "3"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'

## 5. Multi-selection Area Filter

### Test 14: Multiple areas selected (เกษตร OR พหลโยธิน)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \

## 6. Edge Cases & Special Tests

### Test 15: 6+ bedrooms
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",

    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "ทั้งหมด"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

### Test 17: Empty filters array
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": []
    }
  }'
```

### Test 18: Large page size
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 50,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "3"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

---

## 7. Pagination Tests

### Test 19: Page 2
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page": 2,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "3"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

### Test 20: Different page sizes
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 12
  }'
```

---

## 8. Response Format Tests with Pretty Print

### Test 21: With pretty print (using jq)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "luxury",
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "3"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }' | jq '.'
```

### Test 22: Show only total count
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "3"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }' | jq '.totalElements'
```

---

## 9. One-liner Tests (for quick testing)

```bash
# Quick test 1: No filters
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"page":1,"pageSize":6}'

# Quick test 2: With query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"luxury","page":1,"pageSize":6}'

# Quick test 3: With single filter
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"page":1,"pageSize":6,"filterRequest":{"filters":[{"filterName":"ห้องนอน","filterData":{"selectedChoice":"3"}}]}}'

# Quick test 4: Query + filter
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"modern","page":1,"pageSize":6,"filterRequest":{"filters":[{"filterName":"ห้องนอน","filterData":{"selectedChoice":"3"}}]}}'
```

---

## 10. Comparison: GET vs POST

### GET endpoint (with filters as query param)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8888/houses?query=luxury&page=1&pageSize=6&filters=%7B%22filters%22%3A%5B%7B%22filterName%22%3A%22%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%22%2C%22filterData%22%3A%7B%22selectedChoice%22%3A%223%22%7D%7D%5D%7D"
```

### POST endpoint (same query, cleaner)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/houses/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "luxury",
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 6,
    "filterRequest": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "filterName": "ห้องนอน",
          "filterData": {
            "selectedChoice": "3"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Notes

1. **Content-Type Header**: Always include `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`
2. **Pretty Print**: Add `| jq '.'` at the end for formatted JSON output (requires jq)
3. **Save Response**: Add `-o output.json` to save response to file
4. **Verbose Mode**: Add `-v` flag to see full request/response headers
5. **Default Values**: If page/pageSize are not provided, they default to 1 and 6 respectively

## Filter Names Reference

- `พื้นที่` - Area (multi-selection)
- `ประเภทบ้าน` - House Type (single selection)
- `ความใหม่` - New/Used (dropdown: มือหนึ่ง, มือสอง)
- `ห้องนอน` - Bedrooms (dropdown: ทั้งหมด, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6+)
- `ขนาดพื้นที่` - Area Size (integer range)

This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.

<file_summary>
This section contains a summary of this file.

<purpose>
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
</usage_guidelines>

<notes>
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)
